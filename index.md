## What is Coral?

Coral is the first generic, distributed, on-device data plane verification (DPV)
framework. It differs from all existing DPV tools by embracing a distributed
design. Specifically, it transforms the problem of DPV in a network into a
counting problem in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is further decomposed
to lightweight tasks executed on network devices. Coral will be open-sourced
soon, but to give you a taste, in this website, we provide a series of demos to
demonstrate the functionality of Coral.
